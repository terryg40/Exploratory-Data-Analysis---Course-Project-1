#### Exploratory-Data-Analysis---Course-Project-1
##### Peer-graded Assignment using the Electric power consumption data set

##### This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning
##### datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have 
##### made available on the course web site:

##### Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]
##### Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period 
##### of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

##### The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

#####    Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
#####    Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
#####    Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
#####    Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
#####    Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
#####    Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
#####    Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, 
#####       containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
#####    Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room,
#####       containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
#####    Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric
#####       water-heater and an air-conditioner.

##### Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. 
##### Your task is to reconstruct four plots.  For each plot you should:

#####    Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
#####    Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
#####    Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R
#####       constructs the plot1.png plot.  Your code file should include code for reading data so that the plot can be 
#####       fully reproduced.  You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
#####    Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)
